### `DiffExpr_YoungVsOld.R`

This R script includes a comprehensive set of analyses for identifying and characterizing differential gene expression between young and old cohorts.  

#### Main Procedures:

- **Batch Effect Removal**  
  Normalize data and eliminate technical variation across samples.

- **Differential Gene Expression Analysis**  
  Identify genes significantly differentially expressed between age groups.

- **Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG Enrichment Analysis**  
  Explore the biological functions and pathways associated with DEGs.

- **Resampling Analysis**  
  Assess the stability and robustness of identified DEGs through repeated sampling.

- **Data Visualization**  
  Generate visual outputs such as volcano plots, heatmaps, and enrichment bar charts.
